# bootstrap-clone

It was a fun project to do, bootstrap is a great framework to learn as it give's us component which we can use to build website fast.So this project is a clone of bootstrap 4 (old version), I build this to understand more about bootstrap, if you go to the website you will get the same vibe as bootstrap website, i will be adding some more changes to it.
